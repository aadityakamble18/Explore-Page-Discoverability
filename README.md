## Introduction
Understanding user engagement on social media is crucial for content creators and marketers. This project studies Instagram's Explore Page algorithms by analyzing various factors that contribute to content discoverability.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to:
1. Analyze the factors influencing content appearance on Instagram's Explore Page.
2. Understand how Instagramâ€™s algorithms impact content reach and visibility.
3. Develop machine learning models to predict content engagement and discoverability.

## Dataset
- The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of **7488 rows** and **9 columns**.
- Important features include:
  - **User ID**
  - **Photo ID**
  - **Comments**
  - **Emoji Usage**
  - **Hashtags Used Count**
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and format categorical data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key findings from EDA:
- Most users fall within the **50-100 User ID range**, with very few having more than 250.
- Posts with more unique **Photo IDs** tend to receive higher engagement.
- Hashtags significantly impact discoverability, with most comments using **1 or 2 hashtags**.
- Sentiment analysis of comments revealed that **99% were neutral**, with very few negative interactions.
- Users posting **longer comments** tend to engage more meaningfully.

## Modeling
We implemented two machine learning models to analyze the impact of different factors on content reach:
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Used to predict whether an emoji would be used in a post.
   - Features considered: **Comment, User ID, Photo ID, Emoji Used, Hashtags Count**.
   - Provided feature importance insights.
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - A simpler model used for comparison.
   - Visualized the decision-making process.

## Results & Insights
- **Emoji usage and hashtag count** were the most important factors influencing content reach.
- Surprisingly, the actual **content of the comment had little effect** on emoji usage.
- Feature importance analysis confirmed that **hashtags have a strong correlation with engagement**.
- Posts with **positive emojis** tend to have higher engagement and discoverability.

## Limitations
- The dataset is relatively **small** compared to real-world Instagram interactions.
- Instagram's **actual algorithm is complex and considers thousands of variables**, whereas we only analyzed a few key factors.
- The platform's algorithm is **constantly evolving**, making it difficult to generalize results over time.
